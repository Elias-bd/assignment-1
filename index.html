                I will help make students' dream for Bangladesh come true.“We are here: a fresh new face for them, for
                the country... Because finally, this moment, the monster is gone. So this is excitement.” It was a

                war heroes, who fought for the country’s independence from Pakistan in 1971, that sparked the protest
                movement in the first place.Bangladesh is at a crossroads, and We're are able to navigate current
                political dynamics while respecting human rights and civic freedoms will determine the future of its
                democracy.
